# Wordle Clone

This project is a Wordle clone, a popular word-guessing game. You can play the game online [here](https://sgroi-l.github.io/wordle/). The game allows you to guess a hidden word by typing in your guesses and receiving feedback on your guess.

## Installation

To run the Wordle clone locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sgroi-l/wordle.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd wordle
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser or live server.

## How to Play

1. Start typing your guess into the input field.
2. Press Enter to submit your guess.
3. Receive feedback on your guess.
4. Use the Backspace key to delete your previous guess and enter a new one.
5. Continue guessing until you correctly guess the word.

## User Story

This project focuses on the following user story:

**Feedback: As a player, I want to receive feedback on my guess (e.g., correct letter in the correct position, correct letter in the wrong position, or incorrect letter), so that I can adjust my strategy.**

The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating the correctness of letters in terms of both their position and presence within the hidden word. This feedback helps players adjust their strategy and make more informed guesses.

## Future Tasks

The Wordle clone project has several future tasks planned for further development:

- Implement local storage or user login functionality to remember previous attempts.
- Enhance mobile functionality to provide a better user experience on mobile devices.
- Include a virtual keyboard for easier input on touchscreen devices.
- Deploy the site statically using Terraform.
